Few things to note with my personal experience.

# Categories of bioinformatic tools
Generally, there are 4 main categories of bioinformatic tools. 

**1) in R** 
This could be the best to start with, as it handles visulization, and is simple and useful.

**2) in shell script**, alternatively called bash script. 
free codes/tools are mostly available in linux/unix systems. consider has such a system, either a mac computer, or a ubuntu OS installation. Or simply register a AWS account in Amazon and start from a free EC2 instance.
Most tools for sequence analysis are written to work in shell script. 

**3) in python**
Python is more for general purpose and recently adapted for data science. It is more for machine learning and deep learning. 

**4) Graphical user interface(GUI) tools** (mostly not free)

# misconception
1. Computational analysis is not easy, it takes a lot of time. 
2. It works very different ways from biological research experiments. You may spend days to debug to find that an lack/more black space caused your code not runing. it is not a waste of time. 
3. You need a master certificate? No, just learn from your work on it. Most conversion happens this way. You need youtube and google, you need to find the right keyword to get your answer. 
4. Organization is important. You will find yourself lost in massive file systems if you are not careful pay attention to those tools that help you to organize.
