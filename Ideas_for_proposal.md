Title proposal: 
# How to use single-cell RNA-seq to advance your study: workflow and considerations. 

# Self-introduction
Did two projects on single cell RNAseq
Wetlab background in stem cell biology and neurodegeneration.
Current function
Promote/support scRNA seq 
Service scope
Consultation/bioinformatic analysis

# 3 big modules: 
### Biological question--stay focused on your question. 
> Well known advantages
>> Heterogeneity
>> Transitions 
>> Rare cell popolations
>> High resolution
> Be-aware of known challenges
>> Transcriptional regulation
>> High dropout rates
>> Platform setup money/time consuming
>>> Accessible to professionals and instruments
>> Computationally intensive
### experimental setup, 
> 10x Genomics / dropseq
> SmartII pipeline
> Nextseq 500/Novaseq /Hiseq
> Other considerations —scATAC, scCite-seq.
### bioinformatic analysis, 
> Languages    : shell script/linux + HPC, R, Python
>> Organization
>>> Scripts: Version control git/github
>>> Folder organization: cookiecutter
>>> Automation: Snakemake
>>> Reproduciability: Singularity/ Docker.
>> Shell script
>> Rstudio/Rmarkdown
>> Jupyter lab/ Notebook
> Approaches
>> Pipelines
Pipelines are available, you just need to figure out input/output
Consisiderations 
>>> Alignment
>>> Cellranger
>>> Cite-seq-count
>>> Regular analysis (Seurat)
>>>> Clustering
>>>> Temporal/spatial progression
>>>> Differential expression —> pathway/GO analysis.
>>>>> Deseq2, IPA, David, GSEA
>> Selecting candidate for validations
>>> Regulatory analysis (iRegulon, Scenic, IPA) 
>>> Overlap with existing data/cross validation with other conditions. (Geo datasets, SRA etc)
>>> Literature search
### downstream validations
> Expresssional : FISH/IHC
>> FISH are timeconsuming 
>>> IHC need good antibodies <--analysis need to know what kind of molecules to find for validation.
> Functional validation: Virus, Drugs
>> Selection of candidates has to be informed by the domain knowledge and must involve intensive discussions.
