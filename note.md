## tmux 
A very useful terminal multiplexer, using it I don't need to open so many terminals, and 
using the session funtionalities, I can handle qrsh without worrying closing my jobs at the end of the day, or instability of internet. 
# Contr + b, + d : dettaching a session
You cannot use the session feature on a qrsh node, as quiting that node will make tmux missing. you have to use tmux on the login node, then qrsh.
